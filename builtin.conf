
builtin.conf: modernize internal profiles
The goal is to provide simple to understand quality/performance level
profiles for the users.

Instead of default and gpu-hq profile. There main profiles were added:
    - fast: can run on any hardware
    - default: balanced profile between quality and performance
    - high-quality: out of the box high quality experience. Intended
      mostly for dGPU.

Summary of three profiles, including default one:

[fast]
scale=bilinear
cscale=bilinear (implicit)
dscale=bilinear
dither=no
correct-downscaling=no
linear-downscaling=no
sigmoid-upscaling=no
hdr-compute-peak=no

[default] (implicit mpv defaults)
scale=lanczos
cscale=lanczos
dscale=mitchell
dither-depth=auto
correct-downscaling=yes
linear-downscaling=yes
sigmoid-upscaling=yes
hdr-compute-peak=yes

[high-quality] (inherits default options)
scale=ewa_lanczossharp
cscale=ewa_lanczossharp (implicit)
hdr-peak-percentile=99.995
hdr-contrast-recovery=0.30
allow-delayed-peak-detect=no
deband=yes
scaler-lut-size=8
